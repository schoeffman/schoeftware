        <p>
          Humberâ€™s Game Programming diploma program is project-driven and focuses on the design and development 
          of games. I created applications that apply theories of usability, information architecture, network architecture and 
          industry standards of practice. <!--Upon graduation my skill set combines high levels of mathematics, physics and visualization within 
          the field of computer programming.-->
