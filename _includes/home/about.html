        <h3>Web Development</h3>



        <p>

        <h3>Open source</h3>

   

        <p>
          I'm an advocate of open source ideas. Most of my knowedge was gained from open source
	  projects and I hope to continue to contribute with the open source movement.

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>



        <p>
          I try and live in balance and follow the mantra Positive, Knowledgeable and Wise. 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> is one of my hero's and I strive to be more like him.
